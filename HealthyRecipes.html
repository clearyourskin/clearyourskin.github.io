Eat a variety of fresh foods that are the least processed. Organic groceries are preferable, although not necessary. After consulting with Kathryn, a dietary list of do's and don'ts will be clear. Use the following recipes if they meet your diet requirements but don't be affraid to substitute and create your own dishes. These recipes are easy and designed for busy people who do not want to spend hours in the kitchen but would like to eat well.
