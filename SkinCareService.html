Your skin and aspects of your lifestyle are examined and evaluated so that necessary changes can be recommended and implemented. An initial product regimen is chosen from a variety of manufacturers proven in observed effectiveness. You are never obligated to purchase products, however if you choose to, the consultation is complimentary. A better result from your first facial or peel is achieved after using a home care program for at least one week. <br /><br /> <em>1 hour - $100 (complimentary with purchase of products)</em> <br /><br /> <strong>Oxygen Facial with LED</strong> <br /><br />This is an adaptable facial that incorporates oxygen emulsions which push oxygen, water, and anti-oxidants deep into the skin tissue. No ineffective oxygen sprays are used! This treatment is especially appropriate for acne as oxygen bleaches out infection. It is also a fantastic anti-aging treatment that hydrates, refreshes, and delivers essential micellized vitamins into the skin. This thorough procedure includes cleansing, exfoliation, oxygenation and hydration to prepare the skin for deep cleaning, extractions, oxygen mask, and sun protection. <br /><br /> <em>1 hour 20 minutes - $160</em> <br /><br /> <strong>Peel Facial with LED</strong> <br /><br />This treatment is usually done in a series to combat acne, clogged pores, fine lines, wrinkles, hyperpigmentation, broken capillaries, and rough skin, providing a smooth complexion. The strength and duration of the peel is customized for every client, every time. This service promotes a rapid cell turnover which causes micro-peeling and is not over-aggressive. Clients must be using appropriate home care twice daily for at least five days to start glycolic peels. The procedure incorporates extractions as needed. <br /><br /> <em>1 hour - $150</em> <br /><br /> <strong>Combination, body work, and custom gift certificates are also available. </strong>  				</span>
